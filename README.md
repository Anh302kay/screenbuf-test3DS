# screenbuf-test3DS
Basically i was just messing around with the writing to the screen buffer. I don't know why but the examples for writing to the screen buffer use RGB565 for some reason.
I think that's the way it supposed to be done as even libctru has it's own macro to convert an RGB8 value to RGB565.
